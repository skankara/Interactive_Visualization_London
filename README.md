An Interactive Visualization of the 1854 London Cholera outbreak
# Problem statement is similar to the below one
In 1854, a cholera outbreak swept over the Soho district in London. The outbreak reached its peak on the first week with more than 150 deaths, causing wide spread panic in the neighborhood which lead to the flight of its residents. At that time, the cause of cholera was not scientifically established, and people believed that toxic vapors resulting from the decay of organic matters was the cause of cholera, among other diseases. Dr. John Snow (1813 - 1858) was skeptical of this theory. To investigate other causes, Snow made his famous map of the Soho district, plotting the location of deaths alongside street water pumps in the neighborhood. At that time, the data acquisition and visualization tools at Snow's disposal were severely limited by todays standards. Nevertheless, Snow's visualization was arguably the first clear evidence that linked cholera transmission to contaminated water supply.

This project is aims to create an interactive version of Dr. Snow's visualization. The data used here comes from Snow's original map. Additional data was randomly generated and added to the original data such as gender and age of victims to make the visualization slightly more interesting.
